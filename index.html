        <h3> Virgil Abloh was an American Architect, Artist, and a Fashion Designer. He was one of the most recognizable
            designer in recent years who has risen to the hights of Fashion and Design. In few years, Virgil went from
            just
            selling screen printed Champion clothes, and Ralph Lauren shirts to becoming the first African-American
            artistic
            director of the world’s largest fashion house, Louis Vuitton. </h3>
        <h3>Growing up, Virgil was inspired by graffiti, skateboarding, hip-hop, and his biggest inspiration was Michael
            Jordan. He attended college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and received a degree in Civil
            Engineering in
            2002.
        </h3>
        <h3>It was around this time when Virgil brought his screen print design for a t-shirt into his local printing
            shop
            to be printed. The design was formatted so perfectly that the shop only needed to hit print, because of his
            skills, the store offered him a job at the spot.
            Don C, a colleague of Kanye West, visited a shop looking for a designers where he met Virgil, he introduced
            Virgil to Kanye shortly after.
        </h3>
        <h3>Virgil continued his studies and complete his master’s degree in architecture at the Illinois institute of
            Technology in 2006. After graduating, he was appointed as Kanye’s personal creative director. </h3>

        <h1>Rise to Prominence</h1>

        <h3>In 2009, Kanye and Virgil interned together at Fendi, they were both treated normally like any other
            interns.
            This year was the first time the duo attended a fashion show and their interests shifted from spectators on
            the
            sideline to competitors on the field.
        </h3>
        <h3>Virgil’s work as Kanye’s personal creative director, overseeing the stage shows and merchandise. He was the
            codesigner of Kanye’s “808 & Heartbreak” album cover, he was in charge of the art direction for “My
            Beautiful
            Dark Twisted Fantasy”, “Watch the Throne”, and the “Yeezus” tour. </h3>
        <h3>In 2012, Virgil launched his clothing career, Pyrex Vision. He started with screen printing Champion hoodies
            and
            gym shorts with the word “Pyrex” and images of renaissance paintings. He then went to buy Ralph Lauren rugby
            flannels and printed the graphic “Pyrex 23” on the back and sold them for hundreds of dollars. The aim of
            Pyrex
            Vision was to represent the importance of youth culture. Pyrex Vision was met with underground acclaim
            thanks to
            the help of his friends ASAP Rocky and Kanye. However, for Virgil, this was more of an art experiment rather
            than a commercial enterprise.
        </h3>
        <h1>Mainstream Success
        </h1>
        <h3>In 2013, the idea of merging streetwear and high fashion was the foundation of his next brand, Off-White,
            which
            he described as “the gray area between black and white”. When he started the brand, he could not get a
            writer to
            write about his brand so he took instagram and made it into his magazine, he created a brand which defies
            the
            traditional system of fashion. Soon enough, popular names such as Jay-Z, Beyonce, ASAP Rocky, Kanye West and
            others were spotted wearing Virgil’s brand.
            In 2015, Virgil was the only American finalist in LVMH awards which recognized young fashion designers. In
            just
            a few years, he took the fashion industry by a storm with Off-White.
